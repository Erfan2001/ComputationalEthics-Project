# Computational Ethics Project

## Project description:

Initiate the research process by thoroughly studying and analyzing the ethics school, drawing insights from lesson sessions found in the third book or the appendix of the first book. Subsequently, select this ethics school as the sole perspective to be adopted by your research team for the entire project.

Proceed with the creation of multiple scenarios centered around the ethical dilemma of 'false testimony,' encompassing aspects such as lying, slander, false positive rumors, and false negative rumors. These scenarios should be crafted in both Farsi and English languages.

Translate the scenarios into the language of logic, aligning them with the ethical school chosen in the initial phase of this exercise.

Subsequently, implement the logical rules associated with the selected ethical school to these scenarios within the framework of the article under examination.

Compose articles in the English language, adhering to a scientific structure that encompasses the innovations achieved during these three stages of the research.

Conclude the research endeavor by meticulously editing and finalizing an English report structured in accordance with scientific norms, providing a comprehensive account of the three-stage process.
